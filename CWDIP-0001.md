# What is CWDIP?

CWDIP stands for CWD.GLOBAL Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an
improvement *protocol*. A CWDIP is a design document providing information to the
CWD.GLOBAL community, or describing a new feature for CWD.GLOBAL or its processes
or environment. The CWDIP should provide a concise technical specification of the
feature or the idea and a rationale for it. It may not only describe technical
improvements but also document *best-practises* and recommendations.

We intend CWDIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for
collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions
that have gone into CWD.GLOBAL. The CWDIP author is responsible for building
consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the CWDIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

# CWDIP Types

There are two kinds of CWDIPs:

* An **Informational** CWDIP describes a CWD.GLOBAL design issue, or provides general
  guidelines or information to the CWD.GLOBAL community, but does not propose a
  new feature, protocol change or any other modification. Informational CWDIPs do
  not necessarily represent a CWD.GLOBAL community consensus or recommendation,
  so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational CWDIPs or follow
  their advice. Examples would be *best-practises* or *recommendations*.
* A **Protocol** Upgrade CWDIP describes any change that affects most or all
  CWD.GLOBAL implementations, such as a change to the protocol, a change in block
  or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the
  interoperability of applications using CWD.GLOBAL.
